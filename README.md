- A user will be able to type into a form to search for a movie

- (Create a SearchMovie Form Component, that can keep track of the movie the user wants to search)

- Then you need to get the value of the input (which is stored where?) into your App.js and update your movieTitle state,

- How do you Lift State?

- Create a function in the parent, and pass it down to the child component that you want to get information from.

- How do I know when to call the function from the parent component?

### Your user story
- When the user CLICKS the search movie Button, I want to get the movieTitle and search

- Then to make your useEffect run when the state is updated, update the dependency array in your useEffect to monitor the piece of state that is changing
